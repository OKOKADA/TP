ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
tensorflow-intel 2.16.1 requires ml-dtypes~=0.3.1, but you have ml-dtypes 0.5.1 which is incompatible.
tensorflow-intel 2.16.1 requires tensorboard<2.17,>=2.16, but you have tensorboard 2.19.0 which is incompatible.
